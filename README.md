# Start-a-dance

This was going to be a project to mess around with and have fun but I decided to do something else instead.

I'm going to make this into a slideshow with screenshots of my best work and I will update it while I'm on my coding journey.

I'm going to have a simple slideshow but it might have multiple features later on like 'play slides automatically' or 'organize by: year, language, code screenshots, screenshots of the working code, etc'.

NOTE: This is a more personal project for me than anything. I just thought it would be fun to look back on where I started and how I improved.
